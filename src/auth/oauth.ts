  // The library builds its own options by spreading ours over its defaults
  // (oauth-provider.js lines 1348-1353). A spread copies an own key even when
  // its value is `undefined`, so `undefined` here REPLACES the default. An
  // absent key KEEPS it: 30 days for a refresh token, 90 days for a client
  // record. So deleting either line brings the forced logout back, and nothing
  // fails on the way out.
  //
  // Never set either one to zero. A zero refresh lifetime turns refresh tokens
  // off entirely (oauth-provider.js line 1955). Zero is not "no expiry".
  //
  // The two move together because of spike S2. With the client record gone the
  // token endpoint refuses the refresh as an unknown client, even though the
  // grant and the refresh token are both fine. Setting only the refresh token
  // moves the logout from day 30 to day 90; it does not remove it.
  //
  // Grants made before this change keep the expiry they were written with. A
  // refresh does not extend it — the expiry is fixed at the code exchange. There
  // is no migration. The owner reconnects each Claude app once after the deploy.
  //
  // The library also ships a helper that deletes expired records, and its
  // default sweeps up grants whose client record has gone. That is this same
  // logout by another road — and worse than the original, because a registration
  // can be restored while a swept grant cannot. It is called nowhere in this
  // project, and as of phase 12 a scan rule under `scripts/forbidden-tokens.mjs`
  // actually refuses a call to it anywhere in `src/`. That rule was claimed here
  // before it existed; it now exists, which is why this paragraph can no longer
  // NAME the helper — the rule would fire on this very comment.
  //
  // If the reason for reaching for it is client records accumulating, the answer
  // is `prune-clients` in `scripts/grants-core.mjs`. That deletes a client record
  // only when no grant names it, so it cannot sign anybody out.
